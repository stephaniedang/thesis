# Beyond the Cob
## Exploring the Impact of Corn in America
### MDSV Thesis 2023

It’s corn! Corn is more than a delicious staple on our dinner tables. Whether it's a slice of homey cornbread, a comforting bowl of polenta, the foundation of our favorite tacos as corn tortillas, or the summer favorite corn on the cob – corn's culinary versatility is impressive.

But the role of corn extends beyond our kitchens. From its roots in Native American civilizations to its pivotal role in modern agriculture and biofuel industries, corn has played a significant part in shaping America. Its influence extends to our economy, environment, and even our health, in ways we might not always recognize.

This project aims to shed light on these broader aspects, delving deeper into the relationship between corn and our world.
